/*
Write a JavaScript function that takes a string which has lower and upper case letters as a parameter and converts upper case letters to lower case, and lower case letters to upper case.

swapcase('AaBbc'); = "aAbBC"

Tip: 
    write the isUpperCase function that takes a char and return true if that char is in upper case
    use a loop to iterate thought each char of the String 
Test command: npm run swapcase-test
